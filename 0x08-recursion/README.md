<h1><b>Recursion</b></h1>
<p>Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.</p>
<p>Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.</p>
<p>While using recursion, it is important to define an exit condition from the function to prevent it from going into an infinite loop.</p>
